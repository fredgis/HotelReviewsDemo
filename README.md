#### Analyze hotel reviews with AI in Fabric

*Imagine youâ€™re planning a trip to Yellowstone National Park and need to book a hotel that meets your preferences. With hundreds of reviews to sift through, it can be overwhelming to find the most relevant information and filter hotels accordingly. 
However, with Fabric, you can easily translate, extract, and classify hotel reviews with zero setup effort using prebuilt AI services. Then, with Power BI, you can create a visual report that allows you to filter hotels by categories and view their ratings and comments.*
